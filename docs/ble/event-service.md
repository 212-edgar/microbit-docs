# Bluetooth Event Service

## Introduction

This Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) service is a standard part of the standard bluetooth profile for the micro:bit. It is a passive service, that can operate transparently in the 
background as your main program is running. This sevrice extends the microBitMessageBus over BLE, so that standard MicroBitEvents raised on the device can be transmitted transparently over
BLE and received and processed by an attached BLE device.  It provides this data to any attached BLE master device. You do not need to explicity address and API on the service to acheive this.

## Enabling the Service

This service is enabled by default.
