# Bluetooth Device Firmware Update Service

## Introduction

This Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) service is a standard part of the standard bluetooth profile for the micro:bit. It is a passive service, that can operate transparently in the
background as your main program is running. This service provides a well defined mechanism through which an attached Bluetooth master device can request the micro:bit enter the Nordic
Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) bootloader. It provides this data to any attached Bluetooth master device. You do not need to explicitly address and API on the service to achieve this.

## Enabling the Service

This service is enabled by default.
