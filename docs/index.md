#Welcome to our Documentation!


Welcome to the micro:bit runtime documentation.

This resource supplies an abstract overview of the key elements of the runtime.

##uBit
uBit, a condensed name for micro:bit,  presents our common abstraction
used by Microsoft Blocks, Microsoft TouchDevelop and CodeKingdoms Javascript.

It is broken down by classes, which are instantiated and attached to the uBit object
at runtime.

Each document provides a brief overview of the class, MessageBus IDs and possible events
that could be generated by that class. It also lists the member functions that can
executed by the user to perform various actions with the micro:bit.

The uBit object looks like this:

>    uBit {<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.i2c](i2c.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.serial](serial.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.MessageBus](MessageBus.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.buttonA](button.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.buttonB](button.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.buttonAB](button.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.display](display.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.accelerometer](accelerometer.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.compass](compass.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.thermometer](thermometer.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.io](io.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.ble](ble.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.BLEManager](BLEManager.md),<br/>
>    &emsp;&emsp;[.radio](radio.md),<br/>
>    }

##Data Types

This Data Types drop down lists the various different structures used to hold,
pass, and evaluate data used in the runtime.

> [MicroBitImage](image.md) - This data type is used in the runtime when interacting
with various components, in particular the display. It contains bit map information
and supports various manipulations of this information.<br/><br/>
> [MicroBitEvent](event.md) - Events are used throughout the runtime to pass messages
between components or between the system and the user.<br/><br/>
> [ManagedString](ManagedString.md) - Strings are used when interacting with buffers containing
text intended for any one of our interfaces that support ManagedString, namely the display.
This data type supports many operations on the buffer wrapped by this type. It also, most
importantly, manages the memory allocation for the user, and maintains a count of the references
pointing to an instance of this type.<br/><br/>
