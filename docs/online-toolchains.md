# mbed

ARM mbed has an online IDE for C/C++ development available at [mbed.org](http://developer.mbed.org). It is free to use and the micro:bit is one of the officially supported platforms.

The online IDE provides a simple interface for writing, compiling and sharing projects like the micro:bit DAL, which is based on the [mbed SDK](https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed).

## Hello World on mbed.org

1. Create an account [developer.mbed.org](https://developer.mbed.org/account/signup)

2. Visit the [Lancaster-University team](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Lancaster-University) on mbed

3. Choose the [microbit-samples](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Lancaster-University/code/microbit-samples) project, and click the `Import this program` button for that project:

4. Once in the online IDE, select the project you just imported and click the `Compile` button:

5. The build will run and your browser will prompt you to download a file. Save this file locally, then drag and drop it onto your micro:bit.

6. While the program is copying, the orange LED on the back of the micro:bit will flash. Once the copy has finished, the micro:bit drive will reset and disconnect from your computer. At this point, your code will also start running!
