#uBit.i2c

##Overview

i2c is a very common, widely used protocol for communicating with other devices
over a wire. i2c uses a very simple addressing scheme to access these other
devices.

Onboard the micro:bit itself there are two components which use i2c bus as a communication
mechanism, the [accelerometer](ubit/accelerometer.md) and the [compass](ubit/compass.md).

As well as being used internally, the i2c bus is exposed on two edge connector
pins, P19 and P20. This means other accessories that use i2c to communicate
can be used in conjunction with the micro:bit.

##Message Bus ID
